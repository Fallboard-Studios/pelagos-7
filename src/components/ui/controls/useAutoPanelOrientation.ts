 * the panel's own rendered height and a self-observed measurement would feed back into itself
 * (same reasoning useAutoSliderOrientation's own parent-not-self choice already established) —
 * via ResizeObserver, going 'row' once the parent is at least AUTO_PANEL_ROW_MIN_WIDTH wide,
 * 'column' otherwise. Defaults to 'column' before the first measurement and whenever no parent
 * element exists yet — the narrower, safer fallback (unlike useAutoSliderOrientation's
 * 'horizontal' default, since here the two orientations aren't symmetric: a too-narrow row is a
 * real overflow risk, a too-eager column never is).
