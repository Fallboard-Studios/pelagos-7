 * Resolves the global viewport tier (mobile/tablet/desktop —

 * Unlike useAutoPanelOrientation's 'auto' (which measures one panel's own
 * parent element and can resolve differently per instance depending on how
 * much room that panel happens to have), every 'responsive' panel reads the
 * same tier and resolves identically: 'column' on mobile/tablet, 'row' on
 * desktop. No ref, no ResizeObserver — this only reads useCabinetTier()'s
 * existing matchMedia listener pair. See
 * docs/specs/AUDIO_RIG_RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT.md §1.2.
