/**
 * Pure oblique-projection math for a single cabinet box's front-face offset
 * — no DOM, no GSAP. Both wall parallelograms (Top Face, Left Face) are,
 * geometrically, a plain rectangle skewed by a FIXED angle (independent of
 * pop progress t) and scaled along one axis by t itself — CabinetBox.tsx
 * renders them as two CSS-transformed <div>s (skew set once via gsap.set()
 * on mount, never animated; only scaleY/scaleX, equal to t directly, tween)
 * instead of SVG <polygon>s tweening a `points` attribute string. This file
 * no longer computes wall geometry at all, only the front face's own
 * translate offset, which never depended on box width/height in the first
 * place. See docs/specs/OBLIQUE_CABINETRY_WALL_RENDERING.md §1.2/§1.3 for
 * the full derivation, and docs/specs/OBLIQUE_CABINETRY_FOUNDATION.md §1.2
 * for the original oblique-projection vector this re-expresses.

 * consumer overrides it via CabinetBoxProps.popDistance) directly as an
 * inline --cabinet-pop-distance custom property.
 *
 * VoxelTrack (roadmap 11.1.3) is a different visual context — a row of many
 * boxes read together, not one box in isolation — and reads better at a
